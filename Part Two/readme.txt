Locked Door — The cave is essentially a locked door. You need a lit torch to enter.
Hidden Object — The ‘earth’ its the last item you get when placing the stone in the artifact. It’s hidden until then.
Incomplete Object — The torch is incomplete, you need the ember and it to create a ‘lit_torch’.
Limited Resources — In the beginning, if you do not take cover from the sun, eventually you will burn to a crisp.
